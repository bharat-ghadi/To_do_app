# To_do_app
This is django based app inspired by youtuber dennis ivy to getting started with django. This allows us to add remove or update records.
I will be making few tewaks on my own later. This was really helpful to get accomodated with django as in learning stage.

This project invloves 3 html pages.

list.html- 
  This act as main page will allow us to add tasks in todo app.
  Also this have anchor tags which will direct us to another pages.
  
delete.html -
  This allows prompt to user that if he really want to delete records or not. if not the  it will redirect to previous page.
  
update_task.html -
  This will allow us to modify tasks.
  It will also allow us to modify the state of task wheather it is completed or not.
